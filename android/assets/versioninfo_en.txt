Dear user,

Thank you for using Next Bus Versailles.
With this update we celebrate the 1st anniversary of the Application.

We also want to let you know about a great new feature which we added.
You will notice that by long-tapping on a bus-arrival result, a notification will appear in the Notification Bar.
For your comfort, this notification will constantly update even when the application is not visible.
So now, you check on the status of your bus without opening the application. 
Please don't forget to dismiss the notification when you do not need it anymore, since constant updating will drain your device's battery.
